# CV

This is the first repo / project I'll be working on, which will serve three purposes. 

One purpose is to learn GitHub, as this is my first repo and I intend to continuously maintain it. The second purpose is to serve as my digital CV as I will likely use this site to display my portfolio. The third purpose is to learn. 

I started this project from having very dusty knowledge of HTML/CSS/JS, and so I'm reintroducing myself to these languages through this project and others.
