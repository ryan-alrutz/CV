  <h3>First blog post!</h3>

    <p>Here it is! The first blog post. There is a lot to cover here, so let's
      get right down to it.
      <br>
      To introduce myself: my name is Ryan. For the past 3 years, I've worked as
      a financial professional, but have decided to switch careers by getting
      into web development. I not only want to share this experience, but I also
      want to engage with other likeminded people. Hence, this blog.
      <br>
      Herein, I plan to provide updates on what I'm learning, different
      projects I'm working on, and the journey to becoming a web developer. I'll
      post about other things too, of course.
      <br>
      Thank you in advance to those who follow along!
